# Figer

# To do

 - [ ] check if there is a way to restart firefox after changing session
 - [ ] check if I can run firefox just with difrrent dir without actually moving `~/.mozilla`
 - [ ] exclude nam `default` from valid session names (it is reserved for default firefox session that is initialized in first figer run)
 - [ ] add check in `switch` command if given session exists before moving sessions
 - [ ] check if u can use same files on windows
